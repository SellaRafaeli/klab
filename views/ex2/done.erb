Congratulations, the game is now over!

One trial was randomly selected: Trial <%=data[:random_move][0]%> of part <%=data[:random_part]%>. Your payoff in this trial was <%=data[:rand_payoff]%>.

In addition, one estimation was randomly selected. This estimation yielded a bonus of 2<%=PaySign%>.

You also received <%=ShowUp%><%=PaySign%> for showing up.

Accordingly, your final payment is <%=data[:rand_payoff] + 2 + ShowUp%><%=PaySign%>.
