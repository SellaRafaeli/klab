<h1> Dear Participant,</h1>
 
<p> Thank you for agreeing to participate in our experiment on decision making.
You will be asked to play clicking games with many rounds in each.</p>
 
<p>Your responses are confidential and we will not ask for your name or other identifying information. Whatever information you convey here cannot be traced back to you.</p>
 
<p>The experiment should take about 15 minutes. The compensation for completing it is $1.5 plus bonuses equal to your in-task earnings. Following Prolificâ€™s payment procedure, your earnings in dollars will be converted to pounds according to exchange rate at the day of your participation. You will only be eligible for compensation if you have completed the tasks in full. There is no partial payment if you do not complete the study. You will not be penalized if you choose to withdraw from the study without completing it, but you will not be compensated either.</p>
 
<p>Taking part in this study is completely voluntary. If you decide to take part, you are free to withdraw at any time.</p>

<p>If you have questions, please contact: kinnerett@technion.ac.il
